# code~words week 12.

## Final
Here's my [final work](https://finnarundel.github.io/codewordsRMIT/time_and_space/). In the final class we went through the [website](https://simandy.github.io/codewords/) Karen and Andy made showcasing all the students works. It was really fun to see all the cool stuff all the other students have been working on this semester.
