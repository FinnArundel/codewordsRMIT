# code~words week 12.

## Final
Here's my [final work](https://finnarundel.github.io/codewordsRMIT/time_and_space/). In the final class we went through the [website](https://simandy.github.io/codewords/) Karen and Andy made showcasing all the students works. It was really fun to see all the cool stuff all the other students have been working on this semester.

## Reflection
I've really enjoyed this studio. Learning code and how to apply it to design has opened some new doors in my mind about the future of design and my own career. With zero previous coding experience I loved learning a new skill and critically applying it to my assignment, it made me use part of my brain I haven't used much since school. 

This studio has really changed how I think about my own future in the design __*industry*__ and encouraged me to embrace new technologies. I hope to continue with some personal coding projects, I'm interested in looking into some audio-visual stuff for live music.

Thanks Andy and Karen!
