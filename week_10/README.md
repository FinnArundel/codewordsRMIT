## Professional Practice
In my Communication Design Professional Pratice class one of our assignments was to design a creative representation for our own future design practice, as well as three promotional items for that practice. Inspired by this studio I based my practice's style and items around the combination of analogue and digital technologies, utilising some of the skills I've learnt in this class.
