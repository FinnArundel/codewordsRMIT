## Professional Practice
In my Communication Design Professional Pratice class one of our assignments was to design a creative representation for our own future design practice, as well as three promotional items for that practice. Inspired by this studio I based my practice's style and items around the combination of analogue and digital technologies, utilising some of the skills I've learnt in this class. 

For the assignment I created a matchbox, a virtual gallery and a poster I created in Processing, signifying old, new and a combiniation of technologies. I used blender to create the [matchbox model](https://finnarundel.github.io/codewordsRMIT/week_10/matchbox_presentation/) which I then loaded into Processing using p5.EasyCam to move around it. For the [virtual gallery](https://connect.unity.com/mg/other/untitled-31948), I used Unity. For the [posters](codewordsRMIT/week_10/poster_presentation/) I created a [sketch](https://github.com/FinnArundel/codewordsRMIT/blob/master/week_10/prof_prac_posters_02/prof_prac_posters_02.js) where images were randomised onto the page, with no overlap, then had a refresh and save function running to save the many variations.
