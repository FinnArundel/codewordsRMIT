# code~words. week 03

This day begun with a discussion about electronic literature, including generative texts and novels such as AI Dungeon which create unique stories based on user input. The work of John Cayley was also discussed which I personally found very interesting, practically the extremely atmospheric [windsound](http://programmatology.shadoof.net/?wsqt).

The rest of the day was dedicated to working on the first assignment with our groups. In this time my group location scouted for places to film our video much like a production studio would in real life.
