## code~words week 01

After starting the day with initial self-introductions and information 
about the course and itâ€™s assignments, the whole class met in a virtual 
version of Melbourne on Minecraft to discuss how reading may be changing 
in digital space. 

We were also introduced to coding through Processing and given a short 
introduction into the application and its features. Our task over the next
week was to create the first letter of our names only utilising basic line, 
shape and colours.
