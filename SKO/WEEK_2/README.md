# code~words. Week 02

This class began with a discussion on modular typography. The artists and designers that I found most interesting were Theo Van Doesburg and Jurriaan Schrofer with bold shape making up their type, as well as Mike Kelly with his similar but more modern shapes. After this each student gathered their own designer, I shared Jaanis Maroscheck and their book Shape Grammar. Inspired by the work of Sol LeWitt, Maroscheck designs and programmes production systems for shapes and letters.
