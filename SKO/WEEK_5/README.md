In class we presented our assignment one videos. We interpreted the first and second passage of the book in Second Life.

Second Life worked well as a way to interpret the text into a digital space, mainly as it had a certain uncanny feeling about it which lent itself to the horror feel especially of the first passage. Avatar customisation and camera controls also played well with the re-telling, however we were limited to pre-made environments as we couldnâ€™t create structures like in other games like Minecraft, this limited us slightly.
